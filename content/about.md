I'm a __Spring 2020__ graduate from ***University of Wisconsin Stout*** who majored in **Computer Science** with a concentration in Mobile Applications. I've worked on a large number of coding projects throughout the years both for school and for fun. When I'm not coding, you'll find me staying in shape on Strava, playing BeatSaber, or memorizing strange things such as digits of pi or kanji characters. Feel free to check out my coding project portfolio [here](/projects.html) or take a look at my resume [here](/resume.html). I am currently seeking employment as a Software Developer/Engineer.
