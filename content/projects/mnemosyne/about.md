Mnemosyne *(pronounced: "new-ma-se-nee")* is a graphical front-end for [jrnl](http://jrnl.sh/) built with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). jrnl is a fantastic open source text-based journaling application. However, it has one major problem: Interacting with your journal from a mobile device is difficult and error prone. This application seeks to fix that. By hosting a small node.js webserver on a device such as a Raspberry Pi, one can easily create and view their jrnl entries from a progressive web app on their phone or tablet anywhere. Mnemosyne is named after the Goddess of memory and remembrance in Greek mythology.
