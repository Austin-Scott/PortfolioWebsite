**Built for the 2019 [MinneHack](https://minnehack.io/) 24-hour Hackathon.** When we were researching the problems facing farmers in developing countries today, one of the largest issues was a lack of information. Many farmers live without internet access, and are unable to learn about best farming practices, weather updates, or even just current news. However, as evidenced by the rapid rise of mobile banking in places like Africa, it is clear that farmers have access to phone services. We have created a SMS service to help farmers advance their personal education and increase their agricultural productivity.
