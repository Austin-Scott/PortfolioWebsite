[Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) is the practice of hiding objects in plain sight. This application hides files in the least significant bits of the color channels of PNG (Portable Network Graphics) images. This adds a small amount of noise to the image that is often completely unnoticable to any person looking at it. This application was the result of a team effort from *Evan Vander Hoeven*, *Nicholas Labelle*, *Tanner Verber*, *Brendan Bard*, *Connor Fergesen*, and I. It was created as a project for UW-Stout's Fall 2018 Software Engineering Principles class as an excercise in using Agile development.
